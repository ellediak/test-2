												<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2> <!-- added in title to page -->
												<p> My Inspiration As a Future Educator</p> <!-- added in subtitle to page -->
											</header>

											<p>A teaching philosophy is a statement that outlines an educator's beliefs, values, and approaches to teaching and learning. So you may be thinking, who am I as a teacher and what are my values? The statement below is my philosophy that we were asked to construct at university and is was what i teach by as a true collection of my beliefs and morals.</p>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/teaching-philosophies.jpg" alt="" /></span> <!-- added in a photo of me learning to become a teacher -->

											<p>A teacher to me is just as important as a mother, father or carer. They are the primary carer of students for several hours a day, several days a week. Learning is conducted to strengthen their mind, enhance their abilities and make them known of their capabilities. The years at which a child is at school are the years in which they discover their identity. One that depicts who they are and who they want to be and the ability to contribute to that and be a part of that process is one of the most significant opportunities as an educator. 
												Throughout my own high school experience, I was blessed with teachers who worked beyond the basic curriculum and made it their mission to ensure that their students achieved to the best of their ability. In the classroom, teachers went out of their way to ensure that individualistic techniques were implemented within lessons to cater for the needs of each student- whether that be mix-match cards for students who are kinesthetic learners, or mind maps and posters around the room for visual learners, as well as pre-made audio lessons for auditory learners. It is simple  for teachers to stand at the front and deliver content- but when you recognise the extent that an individual is willing to go to, to see you personally succeed, now that is a hero. It was this remembrance for me that inspired me to want to bring greatness to the classroom and be that educator that every student deserves. And moreso, be that believer that every child needs. Because that feeling that my teachers made myself and my classmates feel was beyond comprehension and that is an appreciation I will forever carry with me. So I hope to change that common perception that school learning is tedious and only done so as a requirement, just the way my teachers did so for me.  And I know that all of my students won’t have that impact or appreciation- as much as I would love to, but all I need is 1 student. Just 1. One that will walk away from high school and know that they had a believer when no one else did, and because of that they know they are capable of achieving whatever their future endeavours ought to be. Just that one. 
												It’s a common yet very relevant saying “ Giving is better than receiving”. In senior year, I was a prefect, so as a school leader, one of the tasks was to open the door each morning for students. Within my first few days of duties, I was shocked to see a number of students refusing to get out of the car, or they obtained a facial expression which communicated a desire to be anywhere but school. During my mornings, one particular girl stood out to me. She had these distressing anxiety levels that concerned me. The School environment should never be that way. It should be a safe and happy place where learning is an appreciation and friendships are inseparable. And to see this resistance, and the heartbreak of the mother each morning and I knew this young girl needed change.  I made it my mission to ensure that she was walked into school each day with a smile on her face. I waited for her car, talked to her and walked her in until this new normal was a place where she felt safe and happy. I am pleased to say that I achieved this goal and at the end of the school year on my final day, I opened the car door and I was greeted by this beautiful girl. She welcomed me with a warm hug, and handed me a bunch of flowers with a note that I will keep forever...signing off with the words, “ one day I hope to grow up and be just like you.” That feeling was indescribable. It was those 12 words. That 1 phrase which only made me want to do better and be better. I hope for my career in education to help me make that change and allow me to give back to the system which gave me so much within. To make learning fun and enjoyable, whilst maintaining a relationship with me students who put their trust and faith in me to help them succeed. With an engaging, enthusiastic and exuberant delivery of content, students are assured to be inspired and captivated. Alongside my enthusiastic nature, organisational skills and strong work ethic, I aspire to alter the common learning perception and ensure that each of my students feels accommodated for and is eager to learn through engaging delivery. 
												
												
												The intention of education is to develop a student's capacity through the interaction of their surroundings and experiences which enables knowledge to be gained. As a secondary  educator, I place a substantial emphasis on providing support and enlightenment to the creative young adults of society, regardless of their educational abilities. Thus, tasks will be tailored to meet the individual needs of the student whether that be through presenting cirricular in the various ways my students learn best, or adjusting my instructions depending on the skill levels of the students. This will further be exhibited through advanced students having the opportunity to complete more challenging tasks to enhance their abilities and generate creative thinking within the classroom. Students who are also seen to be requiring assistance within the classroom will be appointed one- on-one time to break tasks down and provide extra foundations to ensure that work is best understood. This will be conducted in hope for my students to feel valued in the classroom as their teacher aspires to see   personal progression and achievement. 
												
												Responsibility, Respect, and Empathy are fundamental values which will be upheld in the classroom to communicate the imperative qualities which will enable my students to successfully contribute to society; regardless of their affluent nature but rather their internal qualities.  Collaborative tasks will assist in this as it engages students directly and increases their exposure to diverse perspectives. Such activities enable respect to be formed throughout the learning process by collaborating and being empathetic with one another as they share different stories, knowledge and personal history. This is an essential learning technique as both the students and the teacher generate an accepting environment for individuals and exacerbate that each voice is heard and valued. Further, by implementing group activities, self-management and leadership skills are developed; consequently, instilling vital qualities such as confidence & responsibility in the younger generation. “Leaders are made, they are not born” and as an educator, I take it within my responsibility to develop such fundamental qualities and make students know of their capabilities by enhancing their abilities. I strive to create a strong and positive student-teacher relationship and make lessons meaningful. By manipulating the standard curriculum through a tailored and meaningful delivery, I ought for my students to feel connected with the content rather than obliged to know the content. Such notions were inspired by John Dewey, who’s philosophical theories were critical to the progressive movement of education. He saw the necessity of  a practical approach to learning which should be relevant to student’s lives. And whilst responding to the requirements of the curriculum, methods such as gamification can be performed. Gamification allows context to be considered by learning content through technology. It enforces the students to be divergent thinkers through the freedom of the task, as well as empathetic to different identities. This experience connects directly to the students through their passion for gaming; hence emphasizing the power of this method. 
												
												When exploring the opportunities which are associated with monetary value, such as access to enhanced resources and facilities- the quality of classroom pedagogical methods can be just as superior, regardless of financial circumstances. As Philosopher, Aristotle expressed the necessity of quality education to be accessible to everyone is a fundamental right as “it is manifest that education should be one and the same for all”( Aristotle, 1996, p.195). & whilst different school structures make that apparent divide, I hope that the quality and delivery of pedagogy is enjoyed and understood by my students regardless of the accessibility of the resources associated with higher institutions; hence progressing towards meritocracy. The ability to learn and be educated will be expressed as a privilege and engaging methods will be implemented to alter the common perspective that school is tedious. Content will be presented in personalised forms to acknowledge the differentiation between students and the necessity to align scaffolds according to the capabilities of a student. Such methods will be conducted in hope to communicate the importance of acknowledging differences. 
												
												
												
												In consequence, when acknowledging that education forms the foundation of society- teachers play a significant part in constructing the behaviours and values for future generations. Their roles are pivotal to the success of not only economic outcomes but the personal progression of students as they formulate their identity throughout the years of highschool. This emphasises the significance of education and its contribution to society. Yes, we are constantly changing, so my philosophy will be adaptable to respond to the requirements of my students' well-being- but as of right now, I will ensure that I am an ethical professional who educates their students from the tailored basis of their needs.
